Refection on week3 material

At first, I was a little scared by the text becuase it looks like a heavy and a complex week. But I tried to make myself focus on the instruction step by step, and do what the professor ask me to do. Then I found out it is actually easy and quick 
to finish.

For the regex, I learned how to replace with ~\1 from the original text (.+\<to\>). After I run the command, all the 'to' was 
gone. Then, I tried to get rid of the 'page numbers' after the year like ~Sam Houston to J. Pinckney Henderson, December 31, 1836 51.
However, I followed the instruction carefully, still can't figure out how to make the page number vanished. 

What' s more, I moved to the next step that I insert “Sender, Recipient, Date” to make the file looks tidy. 
Finally, I saved my file as correspondence.csv. 

Although it was not a perfect example of how to make the data and number look tidy, i gain valuable experiences through the process, also I learned how to organizing massive data in a fast way.
